 Abstract 2: Nation Annihilation
 
The Purpose of this paper is to narrow down the many uses of operating, owning, and using drones. As technology advances, new and innovative ways begin to surface. Drones have been on the rise for years now making their way from the private sectors to being commercially available to the public. We will look at three aspects of the usage of drones in our society. First, from the controller’s perspective the once operating the drones; second from the small business sectors, agriculture and marine. And third, the dangers when technology is used for warfare. By looking further into these three aspects we expect to widen our understanding on the inner positive and negative workings of everyday use of drones in our society. New innovative technology such as drones are made because there is a need for them and with that need comes job creations, the operator; easier ways to accomplish certain tasks such as fertilizing of fields and testing of wildlife; and the negative implications it can cause



Essay 2:	

As technology becomes more advanced over time it becomes clear that it will not stop defining what culture is. Drones being technology used in offense and warfare is seen as an issue that becomes brought up over time. Is a drone to commit murder, or a an actual soldier shooting at people less humane? Sending a drone out to clean up enemies in an area and not be there physically to experience is common. Those shielded from drone warfare have no clue as to what is happening, but should know this is something to address. I myself went through traumas and casualties all because my town was a threat to them. I as survivor am here to tell my drone story.

As I leave the explosions from hometown I see bombs drop from drones a mile away. As I run off in the night I hear screams all around as I hide into my shelter from the loud noise.  I see new drones here arrive to my village as more screams are heard. I think of drones forcing me to leave behind what I cherish. Soldiers are to not be seen anywhere as death comes from the skies and none on the ground. As war in the middle east ravaged becomes more common as it is easy on the operator to take down targets marked with red on their monitors. A world that depends on drones to do military jobs can be its own downfall as drones are susceptible to being captured and used against their own operators. I does not take experience to know that seeing these drones take out targets make a human less as insignificant. 

Someone on the battlefield has grown to fear drones over these years as they show no mercy to us folks. The human is never there as it eliminates as though we matter less in life than their families back home. I understand that specific targets are assigned to the target, but that does not exclude the fact that malfunctions can happen. A machine is still a machine which limits it ti human knowledge and programming. Mishaps that have murdered many in my hometown are a result too much trust in drones as they can only accomplish specific tasks. I only have one hope, is that we bring back control among these droid infested environments.










 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 cloudI’m Awake,
I keep my eyes closed.
Someone is holding my left arm,
I’m awake.
I don’t want to open my eyes.
I look to my left, I see my wife holding my son and my son holding my arms.
The sun is rising, I can see it through the holes on my walls/
Last night we ate rice with some herbs, we’ve been saving for a special occasion and some bread,
We ate good last night.
My son stuffed with food, its been a while since we ate so well, he could hardly walk.
My wife and I laughed, for a brief moment, we felt safe and free
I close my eyes.
I walk outside,
our livestock increased by three more goats and one cow and three chickens.
Neighbors moving away,
away to other villages and cities where they have families.
This is our home, what little we have, it’s our home, my family.
There is no one else.
Last week, at the market I bought some rice, herbs, and flour for the week.
On my way back home, I helped someone moving away,
in return he gave me hay and grains for my live stock, he told me they are moving
With family in Kadel, 2 hours away.
He overheard the military using new flying weapons, attacking cities and villages,
looking for insurgents and rebels to draw them out.
My town is small, I know everyone.
They are good people.
I smell the burning of wood coming from my home, my wife is preparing breakfast.
I see my son standing at the door way, he is only 6, 
my wife stands next to him moments later. 
I smile at the sight of them, wonderful and beautiful. 
I finish tending to the livestock. 
We meet half way, we embrace, she mentions that she heard some neighbors talking;
I look up, 
I see dust clouds coming our way.
I embrace them harder.
…Tomorrow we will eat good again.
