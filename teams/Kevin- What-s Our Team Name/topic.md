Drones: A fictional look at the realities of UAVs 


Abstract 1: Cetacean Rehabilitation

While the concept of drones may seem newfangled to Americans, their uses have become more realized in recent years. From package deliveries to news traffic coverage, remotely controlled drones are allowing us to vicariously traverse the skies— and the seas. Skip, a humpback whale extending 44 feet living only miles off the shores of Martha’s Vineyard, was inspected and led to safety by a series of six-propeller hexacopters collecting data over the Atlantic. Cetacean rehabilitation is being aided by artificial intelligence algorithms poetically and proactively absolving the seas of marine terrorism— of invasive toxins massacring our world's most complex ecosystem. Our new reality—a world wherein we will soon gaze up to the heavens and see a structure of drones bustling about—will ameliorate the way we do commerce, abolish poverty, and advance our society into a globally aware future. 

Outline 
Intro	
Discuss what a UAV is- unmanned aerial vehicle
When/why they were introduced
Basic usages
Videography
Agriculture
Warfare
Delivery
Networking
Search/rescue 
Introduce drones as used in whale protection— what is the problem they are solving?
Thesis: Our new reality—a world wherein we will soon gaze up to the heavens and see a structure of drones bustling about—will ameliorate the way we do commerce, abolish poverty, and advance our society into a globally aware future.
Story of Skip
Introduce the whale skip
Where is Skip located?
What problem does Skip have? 
Difficulties and dangers of assessing whales' health
Measure bacteria and fungi in the whale's "breath"
Like Jonah, the drone is essentially consumed by the whale, treating the mouth like a dentist 
Conclusion/positive implications of drones
Drones will change our world for the better. 
Lives will be spared
Delivery and internet networks will be expanded
Search and rescue will be aided
UAVs will soon become a regular part of our daily lives. As our society further advances, and the possibilities of AI and DAPS becomes realized, mobile networks and vehicles will become the new ozone layer
Drones will save wildlife, like Skip



Abstract 2: Nation Annihilation

The Purpose of this paper is to narrow down the many uses of operating, owning, and using drones. As technology advances, new and innovative ways begin to surface. Drones have been on the rise for years now making their way from the private sectors to being commercially available to the public.  We will look at three aspects of the usage of drones in our society. First, from the controller’s perspective the once operating the drones; second from the small business sectors, agriculture and marine. And third, the dangers when technology is used for warfare. By looking further into these three aspects we expect to widen our understanding on the inner positive and negative workings of everyday use of drones in our society. New innovative technology such as drones are made because there is a need for them and with that need comes job creations, the operator; easier ways to accomplish certain tasks such as fertilizing of fields and testing of wild life; and the negative implications it can cause
