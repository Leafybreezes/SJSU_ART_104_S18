         			            Reading 8: “Thoughts on Glitch Art” by Nick Briz
                          
	This reading is an essay by new-media artist Nick Briz, regarding the “politics embedded in our 
  technological systems” update of the importance of glitch art. Glitches can be collected by being on
  the watch for natural glitches to occur and record them via screenshot, photo, audio recorder, etc.).
  Or they could be acquired by purposely taking a familiar piece of technology and using it in a way it 
  was not intended for. Data bending is a specific method/process that is used to make these glitches
  yourself. Briz explains how the common definition of the word glitch was simply along the lines of a 
  “malfunction or error in a computer or machine”. He wants to clarify how this common version of the 
  definition implies that the malfunction occurred on its own accord, without the influence of the person
  who actually caused it. If two glitch artists were to make the exact same bends on the same file & same
  platform, the result would be the same exact glitches.  To be specific, a glitch is an “unexpected”
  interruption that occurs on a system expected to have an “intuitive” process. In Briz’ words, “glitch
  art is anytime an artist intentionally leverages that moment, by either recontextualizing or provoking
  glitches. When these glitches occur, it is a reminder that, “new media exists somewhere in between the 
  files and the software; Meaning, that this new media is “part data and part algorithm, part object and 
  part process”. It is not a corruption that occurs, but an entire experience from just personally knowing
  one is not restricted to the boundaries that seems to be created with specific intentions. It is important
  to know we have the option to rebel if we needed to. These restrictions can often be for the right reasons,
  such as the World-Wide Fund for Nature Germany discouraging unnecessary printing by preventing unauthorized
  applications from opening the files. This is a solid example of the fact that the organization was intended
  by the creator, therefore an extension of the values of people. With Apple, their iPad has a “code that is
  proprietary and closed, it’s case is shut w/non-standard screws to discourage tinkering + the terms && 
  conditions do the same. Even developers are met w/ financial + political hurdles: you’ve got to pay for the
  right to develop apps that not only generate revenue for Apple (they get a cut of every sale) but give users
  a reason to buy the device in the first place. often apps are rejected by the gatekeepers, dismissed +/or 
  censored”.  As our world becomes more digitally/technologically reliant, “it’s wise to view these technologies
  less as tools and more as environments”; to acquire a “digital literacy”.  In addition to the rebellion factor 
  is the exploratory approach to discovering new methods of utilization to go “beyond the limits” of what it was
  intended for.
