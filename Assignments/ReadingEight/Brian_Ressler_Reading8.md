## Reading 8

I had seen some of Nick Briz’s work before and it’s often refreshing to look at due to the interactivity that is often implemented in a creative UX/UI way.  With relation to the content itself, I think all of his points serve to validate the legitimacy of glitch art and new media as a whole.  I have observed that many spatial art students seem to question my practice in comparison to traditional mediums.  But much like classical art, something like glitch art is much in the same way art in the sense that we are using technology in ways that it is not meant to be used to convey social, political, and aesthetic messages.  What is more interesting however, is that Briz makes that claim that glitch art is not so much a medium as it is a way to express new media.  

I have done some data bending in my art 74 class and what was most interesting to me was how one deliberately uses the wrong software with a piece of source media.  With this in mind, it almost feels like breaking unspoken rules, or laws.  This feeling is unique to simply using filters in a deliberate image editing software like photoshop.  For instance, using audio filters on an image is completely unpredictable, and allows for a very intuitive flexibility.  You get a sense of the composition of the file format by looking at it in a different perspective and can make your glitching even more interesting to look at.
