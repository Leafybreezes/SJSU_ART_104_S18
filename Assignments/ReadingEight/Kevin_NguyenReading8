I am familiar with nickbriz.com, having past DMA classes that covered this topic of glitch art and his website design. I’m quite happy to 
be directed back on to his site again and recover Glitch art. A glitch, as he states is not an error made by the computer but by the user 
themselves. This is quite interesting as I never thought about it that way. We usually, or I do, blame the computer for malfunctioning but 
it could be the fact that I did something wrong to cause it or pushed it too far.. Nick also brings up glitch art in video, which is an 
eye catcher for me as a videographer. Googling him, I discovered his Youtube account and was able to find a cool glitch art video called, 
“A New Ecology for the Citizen of a Digital Age.” It is a video where he took some of the most popular video clips online at the time and 
made a montage with glitching. It reminds me of watching an old VHS tape that was scratched when I was younger. The quality of the video 
resembles the retro tv quality with low pixels. 
In relation to glitch art in videos, I am reminded of “Data Moshing,” Data moshing is the process of manipulating the data of media files 
to achieve visual and audio effects when the file is decoded. I think this is pretty much glitch art! It seems like these kind of effects 
is popular in video’s nowadays. Recently, I watched a music video from the group, A$AP Mob-Yamborghini High, that used a lot of data 
moshing and glitch art effects. Im not too sure if they used any templates or presets but the finish quality of the effects look pretty 
authentic and original! I was very surprised to see this type of effect used in a hip hop music video. This actually inspires me to 
experiment with data moshing my videos and see what I can get. Its also pretty cool to see this kind of technique come up in public.
