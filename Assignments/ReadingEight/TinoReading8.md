In Nick Briz' Thoughts on Glitch Art v2.0 he discusses what makes glitch art, how can you make some and methods you can use
as well as the polotics behind why glitch art can be hard to accomplish. Glitch art is where we take a image for example and 
alter it completely like in this case messing with the image's code which will cause it to bug out and give you different look 
from the original. The process to accomplish this is very tedious and can be hard to accomplish because most programs do not let 
you corrupt files in such a way because that is not what the programs were meant to be used for. The programmers of said app want it 
to be used in a specific way. Which helps make glitch art all the more interesting because of the process that is required to get 
said work to do what you want it too.

For me when I was given the task to do this for one of my art classes it was not easy to do. It dealt with a lot of trial and error 
which included like mentioned before said programs not being able to read the corrupted file because to it the file was so corrupted and 
altered that it deemed it no longer readable. I can see why it is a big accomplishment for artists who work in this type of field. They
have to go jump through so many hoops to get it to work properly. And it does not help when most of the big name programs limit you to what 
you can do. Which is why Nick talks about the politics in regards to this. Certain programs are designed to do specific tasks and not go
beyond what they were designed for. 

Overall I think it is a good thing for artists to be challenged in this way because it makes think of ways to break the norm or the system.
Thus allowing them to show how creative they can be and to what lengths they would go to be able to accomplish their goal of creating glitch 
art. The digital times continue to evolve and as a result artists need to adapt with it including finding ways around programs that are updated
to where they try to make it impossible to break the system but people will still find a way to beat them.
