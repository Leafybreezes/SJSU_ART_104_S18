It's always amazing how every supposedly new discovery is not actually new. Here he was, working on a project and thinking it was novel but
meanwhile a ton of other people already had some work on that same idea.
I never knew what Glitch Art was until now but reading this article makes me love it already. Nick Briz gives us a few steps to making glitch
art but in summary he says: "take a familiar piece of technology and do something unfamiliar with it." He gives us a step-by-step procedure
called data bending which even makes it more interesting.

It is interesting to note that most people usually correlate the word glitch to the word error but Briz disagrees with that correlation.
I actually disagree with the author on this one because he argues that the error is not the fault of the computer but it is that of the human.
Whether its the error of the computer or the error of the human is irrelevant to the definition. An error is an error. I would say that
glitch = purposeful error or glitch = creative error rather than Briz's equation; "a glitch is-equal-to (==) something unexpected.

Glitch art can comfortably be referred to as an ethic based on the authors definition. I really like the idea of consciously doing things
the wrong way in this context. The wrong way would refer to using the wrong software or the wrong procedure.
