  The article this week was about Glitch art and is called Thoughts on Glitch Art v2.0. the article is how to do Glitch art 
and what it is all about.  Glitch art is a very popular art form that can let you make art work using digital media. The 
photos that you design our very abstract and it looks as though something has happened to you screen that messed up your 
photo, but in this case, it is meant to happen. Glitch equals unexpected because it is created by using some sort of code 
in order to recreate a picture or whatever you choose to change and the computer will take your code and glitch your photo 
to recreating the photo into glitch art. There are gallery’s and showings on artist work using glitch as an art form and it 
is very popular around the main stream scene.  Nick Briz is a new media artist who uses Glitch art in his art work, nick briz
did tutorials on glitch art and soon became a co-founder of the Glitch art conference festival gathering in 2010. Nick is the 
one who explains and discusses what glitch art is all about, how to develop your own glitch art, and a little about the history 
behind glitch art. 
  I heard about glitch art about a year ago when I took a class on digital media. It is a very cool art form and reminds me the 
80’s because of the colors that are used the create it. I also like how even though it creates this feeling of fear because 
you think you have done something wrong to your computer that made it. The glitch art is created by the software and suppose 
to look that way so you can put your emotions at ease to know you did not wreck your computer, the glitch is supposed to be 
created that way Nick says “it is an unexpected moment in a system that calls attention to that system” (Briz, Nick Thoughts 
on Glitch art v2.0) and that is what glitch art is all about. Nick Briz also talks about how glitch is about doing things 
the wrong way and he encouraged people to do an experiment every day on using programs the way that they were not intended 
to be used. Nick was trying to break an app, not for intentional reasons but just to see what you discover through the 
process. Glitch art is a really impressive technique and I am sure it takes a while to really get a hold on how it works, 
but what I enjoy most about glitch art is that there isn’t a wrong way of doing it and your end results will be your art.
