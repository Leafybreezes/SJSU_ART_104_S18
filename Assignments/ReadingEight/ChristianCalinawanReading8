I think this article is written in a very interesting way. In almost all cases, articles are written with proper grammar and spelling. 
However, this article is written in a unique way. For example, it hardly capitalizes its letters. It uses two &s in a row in stead of 
using “and.” Most notably, the author uses “u” in the place of “you.” Utilizing grammar in this way is interesting to me because writers 
usually try to be as proper and professional as they can be when writing. It is still a well written article, just in its own unique way. 
It still gets its points across and says what the author intended to say.

I also think glitch art is an interesting concept. Usually, an artist has full control of the outcome of their piece. They have a vision 
of what they want to make and create it. However, with glitch art, that is not the case. The artist puts their piece through a process 
known as data bending. This alters the file in unpredictable ways, leaving the final altered image up to the machine. There are most
likely ways to influence the ways the data bends the piece, but the final result will still largely be unpredictable. I agree that glitch 
art is not an error since the artists manipulate the files in a way that changes its data. The outcome is simply unexpected. As an
aesthetic, I find glitch art to be a lot of fun and engaging. Since the outcome is so unpredictable, the corrupted files generally have 
a lot of things going on as a result. The way a glitched image gets distorted, the way colors are separated, and many other aspects leave
glitch art interesting too look at.
