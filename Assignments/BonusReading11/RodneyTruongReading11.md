In “Dear Elon-...,” by Caroline Sinders, Elon Musk is called out for being drunk worried over killer robots. Sinders argues that it’s more important to focus on more real and harsher problems like climate change. She doesn’t however discredit the threat of artificial intelligence and its embedment into our daily lives. Sinders is upset that Elon Musk is worrying about works of science fiction instead of focusing on the current problems at hand, which is understandable. The whole article is Sinders lecturing Elon Musk on what he needs to pay attention on and what he doesn’t. She notes that he has the influence and power, it’s up to him to use it wisely. After reading the article, I agree that it’s important to focus on the important problems on hand. One interesting thing to note in Sinder’s letter is the mention of self driving cars. They are filled with flaws, the biggest being its susceptibility to hackers. If by any chance a self-driving car is hacked could they not become “killer robots” themselves? Should we ban self driving cars then? It’s definitely interesting to think about  the implications of technology in the future, but I don’t think Elon Musk was really putting any thought into his open letter. He’s a businessman, he wants to build his PR and I think that’s the reason behind his questionable push against “Killer Robots.” I don’t think we should really expect anything from him.
