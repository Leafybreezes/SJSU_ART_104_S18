 			                Reading 3: “Identify Yourself” by Krystal South	
        
In “Identify Yourself”, Krystal South presents her depiction on our present/modern day
approach and behaviors towards the internet; and how this is explanatory of our individual 
perspectives of our connection and relationship to the virtual world. Online activities are 
not commonly understood to the extent where we can definitively explain the functionality 
aspect from the creator’s perspective. She presents these thoughts by delivering two versions
of her article without mentioning which is programmed to regurgitate a version of herself. I 
believe she organized her presentation to be such a way so that the readers could generate a 
personal opinion on the concept of online identity, and our evolving relationship to 
technology/internet. She mentions, “we are no longer just consuming”, meaning we have a 
disconnection from our collective contribution to the actual world with our habits online.
South elaborates, “We are putting forth, creating and contributing, and participating in 
systems from which we receive feedback”. In however way it may be, if one is active and 
interactive online, one is intertwining oneself in these “loops”. If you’re putting something
into anything, and it can be received, then it was a contribution of activity, that encourages
response and further usage of the internet. When perceived from a logical perspective, you can 
how it was necessary to educate internet users of the dangers of private information and images
being shared without your consent or knowledge of it. The internet is still a young presence to 
the modern world, meaning that we cannot trust the average internet user’s perspective on how 
they think the internet helps define who they are (or who they think they are, or who they want
to think they are). It is more convenient to convince others (and yourself) by creating a social
image that receives approval from others. It is a way of feeling validation without doing the real,
raw, and reflective work it actually takes to be the image you want people to think you are. The 
unfortunate result is that I suspect that one of the reasons why many lost individuals (which
everyone has a little bit of this quality) are so “obsessed” with social media, is because you 
can conveniently build a presentation of the “persona” you want to feel confident as. Many people 
are reliant on social media to almost fast forward an idea of themselves so they don’t have to do 
the work to prove how cool they are. Since this is a new and unspoken method of getting to know 
people, we don’t realize that our current first impressions on people we follow on social media is
skewed. South mentions how the “alt identity is the cloak the troll wears to work” and that the
“persona exists for an audience, whether public or private, and gains context and meaning through
its relationship, active or reactive, to this audience”. It is almost a cartoon version of the face
we already put on in public, because we have the power to modify and steer it in the direction we 
please. The flexibility and unpredictability of digital growth in our current society is what makes
it important to understand the impact of movement and influence on the masses on a global scale.
