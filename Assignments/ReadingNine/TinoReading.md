In Rob Myers' article "(Conceptual) Art, Cryptocurrency and Beyond" he talks about the disadvantages that the current art
market has with all the nonsense of having proper documentation and the need to do everything by the book. He believes that 
art should be bought by using cryptocurrencies like BitCoin. He says that it is a more secure way to not only buy art but
also by the use of blockchain to verify instantly the credibility of the work itself with the press of a mouse. By doing this 
buying art can become more secure and contain less hassele as a result.

In my opinion, this idea does make sense, however there are still many drawbacks to this idea. One hackers are highly capable of
hacking the system that would be place in order to benefit them. If they are capable of stealing and forging people's personal info 
what's to stop them from forging and manipulating the authenticity of a piece of art. Not only that because currencies like Bitcoin
are hard to require people go all out in buying cpu's in hopes to gather any slight of some bitcoin in them causing the price of these
drives to go up in price exponentially. Whether it's by an authenticator or by computer people have been able to fool these systems with 
ease. Unless a foolproof system can be made, the art market will continue to endure this hassle for many years to come.

What could be done to make this idea proposed by Myers' to work? The art market could create an exclsuive cryptocurrency that works only
with the major art auction houses or sites. By doing so, they could limit the chance of the currency to be hacked and copied by others in 
order to find a way around this system. Not only that but if they did create their own currency they need to make it so that it is not 
difficult for people to aquire like the issue with bitcoin. Possibly make it so that you pay an x amount of dollars to convert it to this 
type of "auction coins" which can be safely used to purchase and bid on works. In reagards to the authentication part of this idea they could
create new tech that can determine if a piece is done by a certain artist based on thier unique art style, their brush strokes and so forth.
But until a proper fool proof system can be put into place, the art market should stick with their traditional methods.
