The article this week is by Furtherfield and it is called Conceptual Art Cryptocurrency and Beyond. It first starts off to 
talk about how currency was always involved in art since the beginning and back in history art was anything created like an 
image or sculpture because art back in history was not as evolved until later on. People were only exposed to what they knew 
and saw around them at that time. It then goes in to talk about different artistes and their art work and how they were able 
to make money off of what they had created. For instance, there was an artist that was talked about by the name of Damien 
Hirst and what he did was take an actual human skull and placed incrusted diamonds throughout the whole skull. It looked like 
it took a great deal of time to do. The sculpture was called “For the Love of God” and it was done in 2007. When it came to 
selling this piece of art work Damien Hirst was able to sell it for fifty million pounds sterling converting that to US 
American dollars it actually cost about seventy million two hundred and forty- three five hundred dollars that is a ridiculous 
amount of money. It also talks about bitcoin as critique, which is another example of how art and money are related. Bitcoin 
is an art on how it is run and made on the computer, it states that “Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a piece of software that 
runs on computers (“nodes”) spread across the network that communicate with each other to reach a shared consensus on the 
current state of a cryptographically-secured ledger.” About every nine to eleven minutes are so the computer bundles 
transactions into blocks, which refers to the first block called “the block chain” which is also known as the “Genius Block”. 
The article also goes into detail about how cryptocurrency and smart contacts can be used to form a group, for instance in 
1972 there was a piece of art work by the name of “Index002” and it is just a room with photocopied paper and filing cabinets 
to represent on how things were done back in history in order to keep record of anything and now we have involved into having 
computers do all the hard work for us and find what we are looking for by using a program to keep artistes organized and 
easier to look up and find their work. This whole article really shines light on how currency and art are connected and will 
always be like connected in the future.
