		      Reading 9: “Cryptocurrency and Beyond”, by Rob Myers
          
	Rob Myers discusses the broad relationship between art and money and how it is
  currently changing contemporary art. An artist’s work is not limited to the
  physical world anymore, it can exist digitally. Before the internet extended
  the capability to see works at one’s convenience, the opportunity was rarer
  because art works could only be seen physically in person. This resulted in 
  interesting art and money relationship dynamics. For example, Myers mentions 
  Damien Hirst’s “For the Love of God” which is a diamond-encrusted platinum cast
  of a real human skull, sold for fifty million pounds of sterling. Much of the
  art and money intertwinement is motivated by socio-economic ranking. Even as 
  art is being broadened to a digital existence, “high art and high finance (or
  big art and big finance) go hand in hand”. So with values determined by 
  rarity/difficulty of viewership/ownership, the accessibility of digital art
  makes the value decrease and the efforts of the artist disregarded (with
  less return for their efforts). With that, Myers discusses cryptocurrency
  and how it’s blockchain technology can prevent fraud or any third-party 
  interference by having a Ethereum platform. For example with bitcoin, it is
  a method of private currency where money is represented by “bitcoins” that can
  be exchanged online. It is considered a “decentralized autonomous organization”,
  meaning that it has no interference from the government. Cryptocurrency is 
  allowing art to be sold without being copied and sold without the creator’s
  permission, potentially saving originality.
