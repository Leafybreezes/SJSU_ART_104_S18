Today's reading is Conceptual Art, Cryptocurrency and Beyond by Rob Myers. I found this to be really interesting and eye opening because I
never art this way. I can also say that this article reminded me about alot of things that I forgot about. 

The idea that art and money have always been involved in each others production made my mouth water because of the large amount of money 
involved in the transaction that Myers mentioned. To be specific, "For The Love of God" sold for 50 million pounds sterling. Hedge fund 
managers and oil oligarchs collecting art as investments came as news to me. On the contrary I had known that art can be a signifier of 
economic position.

Carey Young's "Declared Void" (2005) involved a drawing where participants can step into and then be excluded from the US constitution. 
First of all, I thought this was brilliant. I asked myself how do people come up with this stufff? This is the height of ingenuity for 
crying out loud! Although it sounds dumb at first sight, I applaud Young because from what I can see in the picture, people still stepped
into the space even they know it's a sham. According to the author; "This is the kind of relationship that produces money, or at least 
fiat currency".

This reading made me realize that Bitcoin arose after the financial crisis of 2008 as the new fiat currency. It has grown to a point where
even artists are accepting it as a form of payment. Eric Drass is one artist who is known to have done that.
