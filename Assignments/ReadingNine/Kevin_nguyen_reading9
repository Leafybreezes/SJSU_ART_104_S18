  This week’s reading is from Rob Myers, the author of “(Conceptual) Art, Cryptocurrency and Beyond.” Rob Myers touches on crypotocurrency 
on his article, he describes that the art world is starting to use it. The art market is starting to offer bitcoin as another way of 
payment. Banksycoin is a currencie made for the intent to pay for art. Its crazy to see how money and cash are getting replaced by digital 
money that is made from complex algorithms. However, these complex algorithm generated money are actually pretty safe. Curious to see why 
the art market is getting into cryptocurrency, I dug deeper. To my discovery, the art market is jumping into bitcoin because not only is 
it safe but its direct and has no middleman. The artist who is offering their work can sell it directly to others themselves without 
having to go through a bank for transaction or third party extension. 
  Researching further on art and cryptocurrency, there is actually an online marketplace that allows art owners to sell shares of their 
expensive art works that cost more than $1m.  The owners are able to keep possession of their art while able to share up to 49% of the 
ownership. This allow investors who are unable to afford these expensive works of art to buy shares of it using cryptocurrency. These 
shares are also resell-able in the marketplace as well. I am blown away of how much the art market is actually getting into 
cryptocurrency. It makes sense for them to use it and take advantage over what it has over cash. It seems like cash is getting pushed out 
and digital money is on its way in.
