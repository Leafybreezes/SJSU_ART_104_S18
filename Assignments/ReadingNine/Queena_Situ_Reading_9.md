Rob Myers discusses the relationship between art and money; specifically the buying, selling, and ownership of art. He first talks about receiving a specific document as proof of ownership, but as more contemporary art becomes less physical and more conceptual, how does one sell, buy, or even own it? He ties this idea into the emergence and today's use of Bitcoins and cryptocurrency and how art, along with other pieces of information, can exist with that kind of technology. There is definitely a learning curve to all of this because I am still confused as to how cryptocurrency actually works. After reading the article, I understand it a bit more, but it's still hard to wrap my head around. What I am getting is how unique identities for art, or things that don't exist within the physical space, are generated with cryptocurrency technology, and rather than receiving a physical, original paper constituting ownership, a specific code is generated to emulate that. Additionally, buying and selling art can now be done over the internet with Bitcoin as a currency. This seems to be a complex technology, but whenever something relatively new comes out, it takes time for it to become the norm. A question I have is even though the code is uniquely generated by this technology, it's still a code so wouldn't it be easy to forge and make copies, and basically rendering this identity unoriginal? Or am I not understanding this? I need help.
