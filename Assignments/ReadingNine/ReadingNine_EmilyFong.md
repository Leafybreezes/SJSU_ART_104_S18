<h3>(Conceptual) Art, Cryptocurrency and Beyond</h3>

The article was snippet of history explaining how art and currency have always been intertwined with each other. From the greek drachma coin to the dogecoin, it is clear that there is some design to brand money. Before there was currency, there was a barter system to trade goods. Art and sculptures were important and they carried on to become images on currency. It was interesting to see how artists take currency and make it into an art form again. Cryptocurrency seems to be the next evolution for currency and the concept is intriguing. Bitcoin came around in 2008 and it was the first one. A network of code that communicates with each other to regulate the current state of a cryptographically-secured ledger fits well into our internet age. More cryptocoins have spawn since bitcoin and it’s quite popular now. People are investing in them because they see as the next dotcom boom. It could be a sham or the currency of the future. It is great to see digital graphics as these new logos for cryptocurrency.

One of the art pieces shown in the article was Carey Young’s Declared Void. Visitors can step in an imaginary box and “give up their rights as a US citizen.” People still stepped into it knowing it isn’t real because the law is still at work. It draws similarities to why people buy cryptocurrency. Yes, it could be all fluff but you want to participate because it is the trend and be part of a get rich scheme. I don’t blame people for supporting it due to all the media outlets pouring shouting how bitcoin has real value. They follow a theme of having a very flat design, minimalistic, and a clean website to convince people they are legitimate and professional. However, I find cryptocurrency to be an expensive game. It is similar to video game economy where the currency is digital and the users determine its value. Even Runescape gold has value in the real world and Bitcoin is breaking the wall to be accepted as a verified payment. I look forward to seeing how it will evolve in the future.
