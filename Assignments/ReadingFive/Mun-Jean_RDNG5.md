 				              Reading 5: Ways of Seeing Parts 1-4
                      
	Berger introduces his thoughts by explaining how a painting and the human eye is 
  the same in the sense that, “The painting on the wall, like the human eye, can only
  be in one place at one time”. He then mentions the invention of the camera and how it 
  completely transformed “not only what we see, but how we see it”. They are realistic 
  considerations of shifts that occur with the capability to preserve what the eye sees,
  so that it is no longer a memory limited to only “one place at one time”. The fact that
  the camera can reproduce an image and make it available anywhere is providing us a 
  convenience we do not comprehend could potentially readjust our perception of 
  reality/approach to life. The small/disregarded aspects in life that can only be learned
  in the real physical world, deliver a personal impact that doesn’t have the same energy
  when you see it online and know you can see it whenever you want. Rare paintings can be 
  seen in easy access; on T.V., surrounded by the familiarities of their own home. It is 
  without the energy that would be present if one was to walk into a renaissance chapel 
  with paintings that share their historical significance. The atmosphere would lack the 
  personal captivation that only the real thing could offer. Berger describes how a
  Renaissance church has the feeling as though, “the images on the wall are records of the
  building’s interior life”. They are part of the “life and individuality of the building”;
  this is what we miss by viewing such works through a camera. It explains much of our 
  disregard for the great insight, growth, and influence that happens from any occurrence
  that allows one an opportunity to feel connected. The energy is not as impactful if you
  know you can access a rare painting online and know it would be available whenever you
  wanted to see it. What was once considered special (since it could only be seen in only 
  one place at a time), is now taken for granted due to such ease of access. Not necessarily
  is it intentional, however. It was a shift that occurred from adjusting to the convenience
  that having “eyes” everywhere, allowed. Berger points out the significance in how we perceive
  technological progressions such as these(eyes), as mere advancements of tools (like a bow and 
  arrow) that provide efficiency to our society. Berger stresses the unfortunate inclination for 
  people to disconnect from the raw emotions of personal opinion/interaction as our perception of
  the real world gets more distant. The connection to actual reality becomes this foggy in-between
  stage. We are basically robbing ourselves of a unique opportunity to grow by allowing ourselves
  to be nothing more than immediately content by simply viewing a Renaissance chapel online. It is 
  likewise to unknowingly stepping away from deepening a spiritual connection from the right kind of
  energies in life that make you feel whole and connected as a person to this planet and its history. 
  It is explaining much of our underestimation of the influential powers that can only be learned in
  the physical world; and how it provides people a unique quality to life. A painting can look simply 
  well-drawn until you see it close enough to observe every brush stroke that showcases the strategy
  and skill. There is this much detail that can inspire further contemplation, that becomes absent 
  when the impact in its entirety couldn’t be given justice. The impact in its entirety couldn’t be
  delivered because it went through like a paragraph missing several words.
