          Reading 7: Hito Steyerl’s Conversation with Marvin Jordan, “Politics of Post-Representation” 
          
	This reading is an interview of Hito Steyerl by Marvin Jordan about the “political economy” that exists but is
  not commonly acknowledged as what is truly occurring. They discuss from a creator’s perspective of what the consumer
  is supposing about what they intake. For instance, she mentions how a phone camera will “clean the noise” with the 
  algorithm that was created to make results more definite by organizing assumptions on what it thinks you want to see
  based off of past photo references that were uploaded. Steyerl explains, “You don’t really photograph the present, as
  the past is wove into it”.  She references this as an example to“the exploitation of affective labor” that is occurring
  in the “projections of cinematic arts  and its  audience”, that is not commonly taken into consideration. The potential
  and actual possibility for the invasion of one’s privacy and unauthorized utilization of one’s private information is 
  not to be disregarded. She speaks of “external interference” of what one’s phone could be recording. Many applications
  could shut a camera on or off. There is a “dick algorithm” that could collect any sexual content: “the phone might be 
  programmed to auto-pixellate secret or sexual content”.  It could ,“screen out NSFW content or auto-modify pubic hair, 
  stretch or omit bodies, exchange or collage context or insert AR advertisement and pop up windows or live feeds”. 
  Governmental hacking such as Heartbleed exploits in addition to the images, a set of private keys, passwords, etc., 
  that can be taken and used without consent. She discusses these examples because if it observed in comparison to 
  democracy, it doing exactly what we think democracy should be doing now but isn’t.  We assume with a democracy that 
  you are voting for someone to represent you. She is speaking of how our current government works instead like 
  smartphone photography that uses an algorithm that priorities certain data and determines what should be considered 
  “noise” for you; therefore, the interests of the people are not “proportionally represented” the way we would expect 
  it to in a real democracy.  Even with an awareness present for the potential vulnerabilities, Steyerl speaks of how 
  “people love algorithmic governance too, if it comes with watching unlimited amounts of Game of Thrones. But anyone
  slightly interested in digital politics and technology is by now acquiring at least basic skills in disappearance and
  subterfuge”. So she recommends that we readjust our perspective on the politics so that we may be prepared enough for
  “subterfuge”. She mentions how for example we can disable recording functions when in proximity to military headquarters.
