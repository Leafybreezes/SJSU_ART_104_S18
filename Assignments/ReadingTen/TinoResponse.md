In Nickolas LUck's article he talks about his creation of Holochain and why he came up with this browser to do something different from
the other programs. He mentions that a lot of the time apps like Facebook and Google get information that interests you but also mixes in 
stuff you would not care about by way of ads.Which is true why isn't there an app that soley focuses on your specific interests and not 
based on what you look up one time in a Google search. Sadly this idea is not common due to the fact that we are in a day and age where 
making a profit is priority number one and is the main goal of every company out there for good reason. 

Thanks to Luck he has been able to create a UI that addresses alot of these issues including the ability for example to dislike something 
with their being no option to give it a thumbs up. With this it will give the creator critical feedback that will help them improve their 
project idea and make it even better or for someone to try to express their opinions on a topic that was discussed. This will only help 
benefit the creator to create better projects for the future. Also because of how well it was developed, it could easiy reach Facebook 
levels of server connectivity by simply using a mobile device.  The UI's goal is to allow everyone to connect to one another or to other
agents. By it being so efficient and thorough, it can allow less clutter when trying to navigate menus and allow for easy sharing of data
across the platform.

Another thing that I liked about Luck's program is that it is able to bring everyone who use different and wide variety of apps closer 
together under one roof. And it is true, people can use one program for a period of time and then move on to something better possibly 
leaving you behind and go through the struggle of learning the ins and outs of the new app. My friends and I did this exact same thing 
with Skype and Discord. Skype was not getting the job done anymore so we created our own Discord server for us to use which made it easier 
for us to chat while we each played our own respective games. So I hope Luck continues to expand on this idea and make it official/ open to 
the public when he beleives it's ready to go.
