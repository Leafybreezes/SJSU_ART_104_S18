	My first attempt at reading this article on Holochain was rather difficult for me. I was confused on what Holochain was, especially the 
  author did not explain it but rather its “White Paper.” Trying to read through the article, I couldn't understand some of the terms and 
  ideas that was explained on Holochain since I lack the knowledge on programming and application development. Frustrated, I looked up 
  what Holochain was. From watching a video on their website introducing what Holochain is; it is an alternative to blockchain. It is open 
  open source infrastructure built to develop peer to peer applications with no mining or cryptocurrency. What’s interesting to me is that
  they do not have a business model as said by one of the founders. Its pretty open for anyone to take and make us out of without having 
  to interact with the company. It is a very open minded project and different that will catch peoples attentions. Looking through various 
  Youtube videos on Holochain, ive read many comments where people are interested in Holochain and want to invest in them as they think it 
  will be something big in the future. 
	
  What do I think of it? I cant say too much about it since I don't think I have the credentials or knowledge of application development 
  to give solid inputs on this project. However, from what I understood so far of the idea, I think its really cool for the company to 
  produce this project for the public to take advantage of freely. They are starting something and letting the public take and run off 
  with it; whatever is the outcome, the company will have nothing to do with it. It looks like their goal is to help people and also give 
  people better ownership of their product with Holochain. I’d like to see where this goes in the future..
