		      Reading 10= “Holochain: Reinventing Applications”, by Nicolas Luck
          
	Nicholas Luck is one of the core developers of Holochain, and he discusses the “paradigmatic 
  shift” that Holochain represents and how it could be beneficially influential by providing 
  “data-integrity”. Luck brings up disregarded flaws in our methods of virtual access by 
  comparing those “data centered” approaches with Holochain’s “agent-centered” approach. 
  Holochain is not like blockchain for those reasons. Blockchain is data centered, while
  Holochain does not force consensus because it supports an architecture that is 
  individualistic. So even blockchain belongs to the old paradigm. Each agent has its own
  “temper proof chain” that cannot be copied and shared without consent, or without 
  acknowledging the creator/originator.  Each and every action an agent is making is stored
  in its own chain, thus everything that is made by an agent has a “signature”. So, a 
  Holochain represents an agent. This encourages accountability and allows rightful credibility
  to originators. Content could not be reshared or stolen from an agent, and used without their
  knowledge. Using Facebook as an example, Luck mentions how we “ imply objectivity where 
  actually everything we see in our Facebook stream is what Facebook’s servers (and thus the 
  company Facebook) communicates to the client software that runs on our phones”. We think we 
  are seeing what we are interested in and we are choosing what to view on our own, but we are
  being influenced and guided by Facebook unknowingly. Luck describes it as “pretending” to be
  in a open and public place, when we are actually sitting in Mark Zuckerberg’s living room. 
  “Facebook is saying something and we are listening”, we react to it, then Facebook profits
  from the data it acquired. Luck stresses that, “mistaking one agent, one perspective, for the
  truth™ is a common correlate of an oversimplifying data-centric architecture and something that
  implies or promotes centralization of power”. So Holochain is this improved, and far more
  efficient version of the internet that prevents data from being stolen and used against users. 
  It can prevent this data collection from feeding you news that slyly guide your behaviors.
