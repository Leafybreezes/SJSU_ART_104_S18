In the article Holochain: Reinventing Application by Nicolas Luck and as reading it, it seems like holochain is a term people 
are trying to adapt to in order to use it correctly in their work. So, my understanding of what Holochain is about is a 
software that you use to make applications of whatever it is you are trying to invent. By far this article was very difficult 
to understand since I have no understanding on programming and what it takes to develop an application. The article was also 
very difficult to read because the author does not explain what Holochain is or what it does in an understand way. I also 
couldn’t understand the ideas that the author was talking about. Reading this article was a difficult read to me because 
I wasn’t comprehending the topic since the beginning, but I did look up Holochain on the internet and this is what it told 
me. One website told me that Holochain was a data program engine used for distributing applications so that is to be able to 
run applications locally on any person device you are using .Another website told me that Holochain is an efficient energy 
post-blockchain ledger system and decentralized application platfor that users networking for processing agents centric 
agreement and consensus systems between users.
Even though looking up the definition and trying my best to figure out what Holochain is I still found myself still trying 
to understand what it all means. I believe that has to do with the fact that I am not as knowledgeable about programing 
and application developing so to me it all still does not make a lot of sense. It sounds like Holochain is a cool platform 
for programmers to do more with what they are working on and it sounds like a great program to look further into, if you 
are computer literate.
