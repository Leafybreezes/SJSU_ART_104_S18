The article is titled Holochain: Reinventing Applications, by Nicloas Luck. 
Holochain turns out to be some sort of blockchain but is actually framework for writing fully distributed peer-to-peer applications.
It is not based on blockchain technology but it is a decentralized platform unlike ethereum. From the reading I realized it works better and
performs better than ethereum by far.
Luck sees alot of posibilities for Holochain and that's what makes this reading interesting. The passion with which he talks about holochain 
and the futurism he expresses. 
At the core of his predictions about holochain is the move from data-centric to agent-centric architecture. The agents are humans and their 
machines, the constitute the foundation of this idea. My understanding of his logic is one void of objective truth, a word in which expression is denied.
I find this hard to wrap my mind around but I believe if I had a computer science background, it will be easier for me to visualize.
The move from data-centrism to agent-centrism can only be understood by realizing that data works hand in hand with context.
After this reading, I think it's safe to say that holochain is a human/social network because of it's agent-centric architecture. I would
definitely love to learn more about this.
